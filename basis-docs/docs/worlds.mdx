# Creating Your World
## Set up the Unity Editor
- As per the [Getting Started](https://github.com/dooly123/Basis/wiki/Getting-Started#installing-unity) section for installing the latest supported Unity editor version and acquiring the Basis framework.
- Open Unity Hub and add an existing project, choose the extracted/cloned Basis project folder.
- Once the Unity Project has loaded, you can now load your World files:
- Either,
  - Find 'Assets' in the Project hierarchy, inside 'Assets' right-click any empty space and select 'Show in Explorer'.
  - Copy in your World files [Mesh/Materials/Textures, etc].
- or
  - Import a .unity package containing your files, from the Assets menu, Import Package > Custom Package.
- Bring back the Unity window and allow the import process to finish.

## Minimum Requirements for a functional Basis Scene
- Import your world meshes or create a new 3D object, such as a Plane or Cube. Ensure a Collider is present.
- Create a gameObject, give it a suitable name, and on the Inspector click 'Add Component' and find/select the Basis Scene component.

- At this point you can create another gameObject, name it Spawn, and then place it somewhere in the world that you would like players to spawn into the world at, or simply use the same gameObject that was created for the Basis Scene component.

- Either way, make sure you place the gameObject of your spawn position of choice into the 'Spawn Point' field and then it will use the transform of that gameObject.

## Test the scene
- Once the AssetBundle has been created, you can load this via the 'BootManager' prefab found at 'Assets > Prefabs > Boot'.

- You can place the location of the new AssetBundle under the 'Meta URL' & 'Bundle URL' fields, along with the 'Unlock Password' provided in the 'dontuploadmepassword.txt' file generated in the '/AssetBundles/' directory.

- Load the 'Initialization' scene from 'Assets > Scenes', and then hit Play.

- You should then load in at the spawn location of your world.
